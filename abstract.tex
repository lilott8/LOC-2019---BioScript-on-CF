Designing, fabricating, and testing microfluidic laboratory-on-a-chip (LoC) devices is an complex task requiring collaboration from biologists, chemists, engineers, and computer scientists --- 
a time-intensive and human-resource-expensive process for small devices promising large time- and cost-saving benefits.
In this paper, we introduce an automated system capable of fabricating LoC devices from a domain specific language.
The workflow expedites the development of new chips while simultaneously allowing for far greater complexity of microfluidic devices than currently tenable.
